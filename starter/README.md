This is a bare bones app in the format that firebase expects.

To get started, you can setup an entirely new Firebase project by following [this video completely](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YzNIwjk7QeiHvXQVx-5K9gucKOOrqu4A/view). Or you can reuse the one from yesterday by deleting all the data in it and running the following commands in this directory:
* `firebase init`
    * Select the options noted in the above video starting at 4:57.


Once that is setup, you can start serving by running: `firebase emulators:start --only hosting`
